### About Me ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm Jonathan!

I'm a passionate developer who loves to build apps and explore new technologies. 

As a recent Computer Science graduate from Boston University with an interdisciplinary background in Neuroscience, I can create human-centric and streamlined solutions that bridge the gap between an idea and real-world application.
Outside of the office, you'll often find me playing golf and sim racing, chasing the thrill of new challenges. 

## Current Focus ðŸš€
